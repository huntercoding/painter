In the page that you want to add the Painter into,
add in the head:
	
	<script type="text/javascript" src="/painter/jquery/jquery.js"></script>
	<script type="text/javascript" src="/painter/painter.js"></script>

and add in the body:

	<div id="painter"></div>
	<script language="javascript">$('#painter').painter([options]);</script>

Where [options] is the options that you wish to set.
